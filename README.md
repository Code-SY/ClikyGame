### Cliky Game

This app is a memory game with React. This project required from me to break up application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events. 

#### In this game:

- The app renders different images to the screen. Each image listen for click events.

- The app keeps track of the user's score. The user's score incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score  resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

- Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.

- Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
